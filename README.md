circos-arrayQC
==============

This project is for making standard quality tests for microarray data available.

Please install:

R -> http://www.r-project.org/
Bioconductor -> http://www.bioconductor.org/
Perl -> http://www.perl.org/
circos -> http://circos.ca/

in advance for using the introduced method here.
Then download both files (folder: circos-arrayQC) and follow the instructions in file "performQualityAnalysis.R", 
-> i.e. paste each line in an R command prompt.
The results is a demo of the circos quality plot´s presented in:

Martin Koch and Michael Wiese "Quality Visualization of Microarray Datasets Using Circos"
Microarrays 2012, 1(2), 84-94; http://www.mdpi.com/2076-3905/1/2/84/htm
